# README -- Code The Dream Rails Lesson 3.1

This repository contains the framework for the blog application you will develop as you go through the
Treehouse videos on Rails development. You should create a git branch called blog and make your changes
to that branch. You should add and commit your changes periodically, and you should push them to github
periodically as well. Then, on completion of the Treehouse Rails videos, once you have made all the
changes to your version of the blog application that the instructor in the videos has made, you can
submit a pull request for review.

After you clone your assignment repository, be sure to run bundle install and yarn install
before you try to bring up the
code. That will be necessary for subsequent rails assignments as well.

As you watch the videos, be sure you make all the changes that the instructor is making to his version of
the application. Otherwise you won't remember the video content. At several times during the videos, the
instructor shows alternate ways of doing things. You should comment out what you have instead of erasing
it, so that you have a record of each way to implement a particular function.

The blog application is modified in the Treehouse videos for Ruby on Rails 5 Basics and Rails Routes and
Resources.  When you complete Rails Routes and Resources, push your blog branch to github, create
a pull request, and submit your work using Squibby.

For assignment 3.2, you will continue work with this same repository.
While the blog branch is active, create a new branch called associations.  This involves
work to be added to the work in the blog branch.  You will use the same repository,
but the new associations branch, to complete the work in the video called
Active Record Associations in Rails. You are done with it when you have completed that
last video. The Active Record Associations in Rails video also involves several other Rails applications,
and there are separate assignments and git repositories for those.  They are the community,
periodical, and mdb repositories.  In submitting your code, include links for all four pull requests.
